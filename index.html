<p>This is where I'll be keeping details of some of the projects I've worked on. </p>

<h3>Insect Disgust Study</h3>

<p>This study was part of my undergraduate degree in Psychology. Although the original thesis was
    completed with SPSS I recompleted the analysis using R and have also produce a few more interesting
    charts. This was published as a
    <a href="http://sahjournal.com/index.php/sah/article/view/29">journal article</a><p>

<h3>Kids Food and Facebook Study</h3>

<p>This study was completed as part of my Msc in Psychology. R files are up
    on <a href="https://github.com/barrysheppard/KidsFoodandFacebook">Github</a>.
    Data was cleaned using R with analysis completed using ANOVAs and GLM analysis.

<h3>Legend of the Five Rings</h3>

<p>This customisable card game has players representing different factions facing off against each other.
    As a player myself I have an interest in seeing which clan are doing the best. Using R I've
    produded a number of <a href="https://github.com/barrysheppard/L5R">scripts</a>
    to prepare tournament lists and win percentages. These scripts were used to prepare image for
    <a href="http://imperialadvisor.com/wp/2018/03/16/meta-check-paris-win-rates/">articles</a>
    discussing the game.
